This project showcases advanced techniques for creating realistic and engaging gameplay. From the dynamic movement of the hover car, to the detailed weapon effects, The code is modular and organized, making it easy to understand and customize.

This project is a perfect starting point for anyone looking to create a sci-fi or futuristic game, or for anyone looking to improve their Game development skills.

### Note
This is an old project on mine created back in september 2021 while i was myself learning new things so there might be scope to optimize code's performance
